Heat oil for deep-frying in wok or deep-fryer to 375 degrees F. Add chicken
pieces, a small batch at time, and fry 3 to 4 minutes or until golden and

## Orange Sauce

(This is the original sauce designed to mimic orange chicken at Panda Express)

Original recipie called for 1/2 tablespoon of sugar, but recommend 1/2 cup of
sugar at least.  Spenda works but may require extra cornstarch.

Combine orange zest, orange juice, granulated sugar, chicken stock and soy
sauce in a small bowl and set aside.

Optionally, try adding more sugar next time1
Optionally, garnish with very thin orange slices

## Lemon Sauce
We tried this and it turned out well, but not sweet enough, so I upped the sugar.

Combine lemon zest, lemon juice, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, chicken stock and soy
sauce in a small bowl and set aside.
