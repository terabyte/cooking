* 4-8 (1-2 bunches) of green onions
* 1 red bell pepper
* Sesame, Peanut, or vegetable oil (in that order of preference) for frying
* Extra aromatics (minced garlic/ginger)

Variations
====
* You can add udon or other noodles
* You can substitute beef for the chicken
* You can add toasted sesame seed topping
* I increase ginger to 1/2 cup and garlic to 1.5 cups, but the original recipie already called for equal parts ginger/garlic so it has already been increased a little to replicate the restaurant taste.
* Splenda can be substituted for the sugar
* recipie scales well to 2x or 3x, but any bigger and you need a huge wok to make it in.
* Goes great with steamed rice

Directions
====

Prepare sauce in blender.  Add dry ingreedients (sugar, garlic, ginger, chili
pepper).  Add soy sauce.  Blend a bit to mix.  Add remaining sauce
ingreedeints, saving cornstarch for last.  slowly add corn starch, blending as
you add it.  This can sit while you do the rest of the stir-frying.

Chop your veggies.  Cut green onions into tiny slices, disgarding the unusable
parts (bulb, tops).  Cut your broccoli into bitesize pieces.  Cut chicken into
thin strips about 1/2 to 1 centimeter in diamater, and 1-2 inches long.  Lazy
version, it is acceptable to have 1in X 1in X 2in pieces.  Have everything
ready-to-go in bowls.

In a large wok, coat bottom in oil.  Turn up heat all the way.  You know the
oil is ready if, when you put a dab of minced garlic in, it immediately
sizzles.  Once ready, apply your aromatic (can be 1 tablespoon garlic, or 1.5
teaspoons garlic 1.5 teaspoons ginger) then immediately add vegetables.  Add
things that take longer first (like broccoli, then onions, then others).  Stir
quickly after adding veggies to coat evenly in oil/aromatics.  Once all veggies
are well coated, pour in 1/4 cup of water, and cover wok.  Steam for at least
10 minutes, or until water is gone.  Check regularly to avoid over-cooking.

Move cooked veggies to a separate bowl.  Wipe out wok if needed, then re-apply
oil.  When heat returns, add aromatic as above, then dump in the chicken.
Again, stir immediately.  After chicken starts to look cooked on the outside,
again add 1/4 cup water and add a lid to steam for about 10 minutes, or until
water is gone.  Cut into a large piece to ensure it is cooked fully.

Optionally, drain the chicken.

Turn heat down to medium.  Now add both veggies and chicken to the wok.  Blend
the sauce for a few seconds right before pouring to ensure nothing has settled,
then pour it over the stir-fry.  Stir to coat evenly.  Reduce heat and continue
to simmer until sauce thickens. Serve directly out of the wok, over steamed rice.
