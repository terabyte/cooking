Chicken Carbonara

Buca di Beppo uses prosciutto instead of bacon in this dish, because prosciutto
has a lot less fat. A classic carbonara dish uses bacon, says executive
chef-partner Joshua Schreiber.

Schreiber says prosciutto gives it a more robust flavor, too. Make sure you
saute the prosciutto until it's crispy on the outside but still chewy on the
inside, and always cook on medium heat for this dish.

The Alfredo sauce is not the classic Buca di Beppo recipe -- that's a secret.
But Schreiber offers his own interpretation.

In a saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat until very hot.

Add the prosciutto slices, and saute until the prosciutto starts to brown and has bubbly white caps (see Photo 1).

Add the chopped garlic and saute just long enough for the garlic to begin to caramelize (Photo 2).

Add the chicken, cream and Alfredo sauce, and slowly bring the sauce to a simmer.

Add the peas (Photo 3), and season with black pepper.

Cook until the sauce thickens slightly and the chicken is hot.

Toss the cooked pasta with the sauce and incorporate well (Photo 4). Serve immediately.
