Prep Time: 30 minutes

Yields: 4 sandwiches

Ingredients
====

* 2   skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 6 ounces each)
*     Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
* 1   teaspoon paprika
*     Peanut oil, for frying
* 1   large egg
* 1/2 cup nonfat milk
* 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/4 cup whole-wheat flour
* 1   tablespoon malted milk powder
* 1   tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/4 teaspoon dry mustard
* 1   sour pickle, cut into 8 slices, plus 1 tablespoon pickle juice from the jar
* 2   teaspoons white vinegar
* 4   soft hamburger buns, split
* 1   tablespoon unsalted butter, softened

Directions
====

Cut the chicken breasts in half horizontally to make 4 thin cutlets. Place the
cutlets between 2 pieces of heavy-duty plastic wrap and pound to 1/8-inch thick
with a mallet or heavy skillet. Season the chicken with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2
teaspoon each pepper and paprika.

Heat about 2 inches peanut oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat until a
deep-fry thermometer registers 325 degrees F. Meanwhile, whisk the egg, milk
and 2 tablespoons water in a baking dish. Whisk both flours, the malted milk
powder, confectioners sugar, baking soda, dry mustard, the remaining 1/2
teaspoon paprika and 1 teaspoon each salt and pepper in another dish. Toss the
pickle slices, pickle juice and vinegar in a bowl and set aside.

Working in batches, dip the chicken in the egg mixture, turning to coat, then
dredge in the flour mixture and shake off any excess. Fry the chicken in the
hot oil until golden brown, about 4 minutes, adjusting the heat as needed.
Drain on paper towels.

Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Spread the cut sides of the buns with
some of the butter and lightly toast in the skillet, buttered-side down; spread
with more butter. Put 2 pickle slices on each bun bottom; top with a piece of
chicken and cover with the bun tops.
